EnumPolicy.GMO_Seed_Insect_Resistance_Research.gameText=Each participating region spends X million dollars to fund GMO seed research for increasing insect resistance of target crop.
EnumPolicy.GMO_Seed_Insect_Resistance_Research.draftAffects=When drafting this policy, player selects a crop and an amount X to be paid by EACH player who approves the policy.
EnumPolicy.GMO_Seed_Insect_Resistance_Research.votesRequired=1 through all

EnumPolicy.GMO_Seed_Insect_Resistance_Research.modelEffects=5% bonus to effectiveness of total dollars spent per participating region.
EnumPolicy.GMO_Seed_Insect_Resistance_Research.description=Starting 10 years after research, permanent reduction in kg/km<sup>2</sup> of pesticides for target crop. All player and non-player regions in world who permit GMO in their region receive this benefit.  Benefit yield is an ease-in-out cubic bezier function of effective dollars spent and target crop.


EnumPolicy.International_Food_Relief_Program.title=International Food Relief Program
EnumPolicy.International_Food_Relief_Program.gameText=Each participating region spends X million dollars to purchase their own regions commodity food for relief of world hunger.
EnumPolicy.International_Food_Relief_Program.draftAffects=When drafting this policy, player selects an amount X to be paid by EACH player who approves the policy.
EnumPolicy.International_Food_Relief_Program.votesRequired=1 through all
EnumPolicy.International_Food_Relief_Program.eligibleRegions=All U.S.
EnumPolicy.International_Food_Relief_Program.modelEffects=Commodity food is distributed to relief world hunger \
in the most efficient manor discovered by the sim where \
efficiency calculation is based on the type of commodity \
available in each participating region, each \
country's nutritional need and each country's import penalty function. \
Note: depending on yields, different regions may contribute different \
mixes of commodities. \
\
10% bonus to effectiveness of total dollars spent per participating region.\
\
Food purchased for relief inflates the global sell price of the food type by a \
direct reduction of supply without effect on demand (since those to whom the \
relief is delivered are presumed to lack the resources to have been part of the demand).


EnumPolicy.Efficient_Irrigation_Incentive.title=Efficient Irrigation Incentive

spent by farmers in players region for improved irrigation efficiency is tax deductible.
EnumPolicy.Efficient_Irrigation_Incentive.draftAffects=When drafting this policy, player selects a percentage X [1% through 100%].
EnumPolicy.Efficient_Irrigation_Incentive.votesRequired=Automatic
EnumPolicy.Efficient_Irrigation_Incentive.modelEffects=The sim estimates the number and location of farms within \
the region and the amount spent by those farms on improved irrigation. The \
model will need a current distribution of irrigation efficiency levels, the \
four control points of an ease-in-out cubic Bezier function giving efficiency \
increase as a function of dollars spent and a distribution of current water \
sources being used by farms. \
Depending on the region and the area within the region, the effects of lower \
water usage might include a permanent (through endgame) reduction of farming \
costs, aquifer depletion, and/or river flow depletion. Increased irrigation \
efficiency also reduces pesticides, fertilizer, and turbidity levels in \
outflowing rivers. \
 \
X% of the money that the sim estimates is spent for improved irrigation \
is deducted from the regions tax revenue at the start of the next turn. \

EnumPolicy.Foreign_Aid_for_Farm_Infrastructure.title=Foreign Aid for Farm Infrastructure

EnumPolicy.Foreign_Aid_for_Farm_Infrastructure.modelEffects=model needs four control points of each ease-in-out cubic Bezier \
function giving investment verses food trade penalty function reduction. This one \
time spending permanently reduces the regions penalty function. \
If approved, each US region must pay X million.
   

EnumPolicy.Covert_Intelligence.title=Covert Intelligence
EnumPolicy.Covert_Intelligence.gameText=You get to covertly examine target player's hand \
and the top two cards of that player's deck. You may target yourself. \
During the voting phase, other players will see that you have \
played this card, but not know its target. Bonus: If you can \
correctly answer a hidden research question, you examine the top seven \
cards of the target player's deck.
EnumPolicy.Covert_Intelligence.draftAffects=When drafting this policy, if the player correctly answers a \
random, but topical, trivia question, then X=7, otherwise X=2.
EnumPolicy.Covert_Intelligence.votesRequired=Automatic
EnumPolicy.Covert_Intelligence.modelEffects=The fact that such cards as this exist, implies the draw pile must \
be set at the start of the game rather than cards being randomly picked at draw \
time.

EnumPolicy.Clean_River_Incentive.title=Clean River Incentive
EnumPolicy.Clean_River_Incentive.gameText=X% tax break for farmers in my region who reduce by Y% \
the outflow of pesticides and fertilizers from their farms \
into the rivers.
EnumPolicy.Clean_River_Incentive.draftAffects=When drafting this policy, player selects a percentage Y \
[1% through 100%] and Z% [1% through 100%].
EnumPolicy.Clean_River_Incentive.votesRequired=Automatic
EnumPolicy.Clean_River_Incentive.modelEffects=The sim estimates the number and location of farms \
within the region and the amount spent by those farms on improved irrigation. \
The model will need a current amount of pesticides and fertilizers in use \
per square km, the current percentage that goes into rivers, and, the four \
control points of each ease-in-out cubic Bezier function giving pesticide \
and fertilizer use verses yield for each of the 12 farm products and \
pesticide and fertilizer use verses cost of alternative methods including \
more expensive seeds,  natural pest controls, and landscape for reduced run-off. \
The Y% tax break is applied to the regions tax revenue on the next turn. \

Agricultures MyPlate nutrition guide.
EnumPolicy.MyPlate_Promotion_Campaign.draftAffects=When drafting this policy, player selects X million dollars.
EnumPolicy.MyPlate_Promotion_Campaign.votesRequired=Automatic 
EnumPolicy.MyPlate_Promotion_Campaign.modelEffects=Model uses four control points of an ease-in-out cubic Bezier \
function giving shift in food preference demand verses advertising dollars \
spent. The effect is largest in the region running the campaign, but also \
effects world regions in direct proportion to that regions import levels of the \
effected food categories.

to a credit of $X per gallon of ethanol produced, including cellulosic \
ethanol. This policy changes that to $Y per gallon.

EnumPolicy.Fertilizer_Subsidy.votesRequired=Automatic
EnumPolicy.Fertilizer_Subsidy.modelEffects=This policy makes conventional farming of target crop more \
economic and therefore shifts farmer plantings. It also affects the use of \
the fertilizer on existing crops causing a change in yield and a change in \
fertilizer run off.
