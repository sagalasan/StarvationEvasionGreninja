Currently functioning:
Test mode allows user to manually swap panes.  This is used for setting up the layout.
Single Player:  Currently using server's ai startup.  Program gets stuck in sim's constructor.

Known issues:
Visualization is currently commented out, is causing Out of Memory Errors.  Probably has multiple causes.  We recommend using smaller images, and pngs rather than jpgs.  DIFFUSE_MAP is 10kpx X 5kpx clocking in at 11.6MB.
